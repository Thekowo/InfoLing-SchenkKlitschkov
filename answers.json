You Should be Skeptical Before Paying One\nThe price of Bitcoin has been up and down all year, from an all-time high of $60,000 in April to under $30,000 in July. Meanwhile, Americans’ interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has grown alongside, at least according to their Google searches.\nWe’ve taken an interest in crypto this year, too — especially after noticing the lack of guidance for long-term investors more interested in retirement savings than getting rich quick with some new meme coin. Amid the constant price fluctuations, we’ve shared how investors can incorporate crypto into their portfolio without risking their other financial priorities — and weather the volatility along the way. Whether you’ve already invested and want to find the best form of wallet storage or you’re only beginning to explore how cryptocurrency actually works, we’re here to help guide you through the world of crypto. \nRELATED: Top Crypto News This Week\nSource: Google Trends.  Google’s 0-100 scale represents relative search interest over time, with 100 representing peak popularity for the visible term.\nSource: CoinDesk historical data using closing prices.\nMany of the topics we’ve covered are the same ones crypto-curious investors are asking about on Google. Based on Google autofill results, related search terms, and “people also ask” suggestions, we’ve rounded up some of the most common questions, along with the answers and expert advice that can help you be a smarter investor.\nCryptocurrency is a completely digital, decentralized form of currency. It can be used as a means of payment or exchange (though that’s not a very practical use today), or as a potential store of value. Since it’s a digital currency, you can’t carry Bitcoins around physically in bill or coin form; all transactions take place online. Cryptocurrency is also decentralized, meaning it’s not backed by government authority the way the U.S. dollar, for example, is. Instead, it’s maintained by its users.\nWhen you buy, sell, or trade crypto, those transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger called blockchain, which is a permanent, unchangeable record. Any changes to a blockchain must be approved by a majority of users, which also makes it a highly secure form of record keeping.\nThere are many different kinds of crypto, but the most popular (and largest by market cap) are Bitcoin and Ethereum. \n[READ MORE]: You Have Cryptocurrency Questions. We Have Answers\nFor true crypto novices, just knowing where to begin your research can feel like an uphill battle. \nThe questions you should ask about crypto will depend largely on your financial situation and goals. If you’re just beginning to explore digital currencies, you may want to start by learning the important terms and getting more familiar with how crypto works as an investment. If you’ve covered the basics and you’re considering buying crypto, these are the four most important questions you should ask yourself before you begin investing, according to experts we’ve spoken to:\nHave a strategy before you put money down: Clarify your intentions, evaluate your ability to take the risk, and then make a buying plan. \n[READ MORE]: Does Crypto Belong in Your Investment Portfolio? These 4 Questions Can Help You Decide\nThe original intention behind Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was to create an electronic cash system people could use in daily transactions. You technically can buy and sell things with it, but Bitcoin’s price fluctuates quickly, which makes it a poor fit for spending instead of cash. You could spend $50 worth of Bitcoin on something today that ends up being worth $20 tomorrow. It’s also not widely accepted as a form of payment yet, so you’ll have very limited purchasing power. \nWhile it’s not a great means for exchange, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown investors they can be potentially valuable — if speculative — as investment assets. In other words, people purchase crypto in hopes of cashing out for a profit after it increases in value, just like more traditional investments. Bitcoin, for example, has already shown growth over time: just eight years ago, in late 2013, the price of 1 Bitcoin was around $200, and it now hovers around $30,000 (with plenty of ups and downs between). \n[READ MORE]: You Can Buy More Things Than Ever With Crypto. Here’s Why You Shouldn’t\nYes. But if all you do with crypto this year is use U.S. dollars to purchase crypto and then keep it in an exchange or your personal crypto wallet, you won’t owe taxes on it. In general, the more active a crypto trader you are, the more tax implications there might be. Taxable crypto events include things like selling your crypto back into U.S. dollars, trading one crypto for another (for example, Bitcoin to Ethereum), earning crypto income, and using it to make purchases. \nFor tax purposes, the IRS treats cryptocurrency like other personal assets such as stocks or gold. If you sell or exchange your investment, that transaction’s capital gains are taxable. The complexity of your transaction history will determine how much you’ll need to do to prepare for tax season if you have crypto. While there are new companies that promise to organize your crypto for tax filing, it’s ultimately your responsibility to keep track of your crypto transactions and report them to the IRS; so if you’re making frequent crypto moves, you’ll want to stay on top of this. \n[READ MORE]: Your Crypto Is Taxable. Here’s How to Report Virtual Currency to the IRS\nCryptocurrency creators can set certain parameters when they make a new crypto — such as how much there will be or rules around buying and selling — and those typically cannot be changed. But because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, control of day-to-day operations is distributed among users, and any changes require majority approval from these users — known as nodes. \nBecause cryptocurrency is so new and different from traditional forms of finance, the world is in unknown territory when it comes to regulation. There’s little existing legislation around the ownership and trade of digital currencies, although the U.S. government has expressed interest in establishing cryptocurrency regulation. \n[READ MORE]: Cryptocurrency Terms to Know Before You Invest: A Beginner’s Guide\nIf you’re new to investing in crypto, experts say Bitcoin or Ethereum are probably the best cryptos to start with. When you’re ready to buy in, here are a few of the first steps you should take:\n[READ MORE]: How to Buy Bitcoin: A Guide for New Crypto Investors\nIf you’re able to tolerate the risk that comes with crypto investment, experts say it can be a good diversifier for your portfolio. But the crypto market is extremely unpredictable, so you’ll only want to invest a small portion of your portfolio — and only after your other financial priorities are in order (things like saving for emergencies, paying down high-interest debt, and investing in a conventional retirement account). \nExperts we’ve spoken to recommend investing anywhere from 1%-5% of your portfolio in crypto, depending on your financial situation. The volatility level of crypto is high, so you don’t want to risk more than you’re willing to lose. As personal finance icon Suze Orman puts it, the amount you invest in crypto “depends on how much money you are willing to lose.”\n[READ MORE]: How Much to Invest in Cryptocurrency, According to 5 Experts\nConsidering how speculative crypto is, we would never recommend investing in it over traditional investment funds. Before you put any money in crypto, you should make sure you’ve set up a retirement fund, like a 401(k) or Roth IRA. Plan for your retirement by investing in an ETF or index fund —  low-cost portfolio investments with proven long-term records of building wealth. \nIf you already have a healthy portfolio, you may look to diversify with crypto in addition to more traditional funds. It all comes down to your specific financial goals and how much risk you feel comfortable taking. If you do invest, here are some best practices experts recommend: \n[READ MORE]: Curious About Crypto? What 10 Financial Advisors Are Telling Clients About Investing In It\nIn general, experts recommend beginner crypto investors stick with Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two largest by market cap and trade volume. They’re still highly speculative and volatile, but are a little less risky than the thousands of other coins available.\nNon-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) are often designed for unique purposes, like being more energy efficient (and thus eco-friendly) than Bitcoin or as a potentially better means for transactions. But most of them have an even smaller chance of growing in value, and altcoins can put your investment at even more risk than with the comparatively more stable Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nYou can always take the gamble and consider an altcoin if you see promise in it. Just proceed with a healthy dose of skepticism —  investing in cryptocurrency is already extremely speculative, and becomes even more so when you choose an altcoin with little to no history. For most retirement-minded investors, experts emphasize Bitcoin or Ethereum are better options.\n[READ MORE]: The 10 Most Popular Cryptocurrencies, and What You Should Know About Each Before You Invest\nYes, the exchange you use to buy your crypto and the wallet you use to store it can be hacked. If you choose to hold your crypto in an exchange or on a software-based hot wallet, make sure you choose a platform that has robust security measures in place. The most secure protection from hackers is cold storage — because it’s completely offline, there’s zero chance for hacking. But that extra security isn’t without cost either: If you lose your USB-like cold wallet or the encrypted keys to get into it, you likely lose any crypto held on it, too.\nHacking is one risk, but as crypto’s value has grown, cryptocurrency crime has too. If you invest, be on the lookout for fraud. Recognizing common scams can help you protect yourself and your money. Here are a few crypto scams to watch for:\n[READ MORE]: Cryptocurrency Crime Is Booming. Here’s How to Invest Safely\nGiven cryptocurrency is still in its relative infancy, many questions regarding its future remain unanswered. Bitcoin has only existed for a little over a decade — amid constantly evolving technological advances and regulations. The value of both Ethereum and Bitcoin has steadily risen over the years (with plenty of dips along the way), but with so little historical record compared to the stock market, it’s difficult to make any concrete forecasts. \nMore financial institutions are starting to hold crypto, and some large corporations are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Federal regulators have also taken an interest in more formal guidance and even the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Beyond that, many experts see the potential for innovation backed by blockchain technology that could transform our lives in the future. \nBut there is also a long list of risks associated with crypto that could limit its potential value. From the concerns of cybercrime to high market volatility susceptible to celebrity influence and the environmental impact of crypto mining — there’s no shortage of reasons to remain cautious as we look to the future of crypto. \nAs of right now, there are few instances in which using cryptocurrency to buy things would make sense. Of the platforms that do accept crypto payment today, many only accept Bitcoin, which is especially ill-suited for payments, given its extreme price fluctuations. \nThere is a chance that payment with digital assets could become more common in the future, especially as digital currencies like stablecoins — which are pegged to existing currencies and less volatile — become more popular and take on potential government regulation. \n",
